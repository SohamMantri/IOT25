Practical-3:
Title: Interface Raspberry Pi with DHT11/ BMP/BME sensor and upload data to a webpage using Blynk
Aim: To interface a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with a Raspberry Pi and upload the sensor data to a webpage using Blynk for remote monitoring.

Tools Used
Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
Jumper Wires
Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian)
Python3
Blynk IoT App (Android/iOS or Web Dashboard)
Adafruit_DHT (for DHT11 sensor)
BlynkLib (for Blynk integration)
Theory/Concept of Experiment
Blynk is an IoT platform that allows remote monitoring of sensor values using a mobile app or web dashboard.The Raspberry Pi reads sensor data via GPIO pins and processes it using Python scripts. It connects to the Blynk cloud via Wi-Fi to upload real-time sensor data.
The Raspberry Pi sends real-time data to the Blynk cloud, which updates the dashboard. DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity. Raspberry Pi reads the data and uploads it to Blynk. Blynk dashboard/app displays the real-time sensor values.


Procedure
1. Hardware Connections
DHT11 Pin    Raspberry Pi Pin
VCC    3.3V    
GND    GND
DATA  GPIO 4 (or any GPIO)

2. Install Required Libraries
Update Raspberry Pi:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Install Python Libraries:
pip install Adafruit_DHT BlynkLib

3. Create a Blynk Project
Download Blynk (Android/iOS) or use Blynk Web Dashboard.
Sign up and create a new project.
Select "Raspberry Pi" as the hardware.
Copy the authentication token (to be used in the Python script).
Add Widgets to display temperature and humidity:
Value Display (V0 for Temperature, V1 for Humidity)

4. Write and Upload the Python Code
Python Script for DHT11 & Blynk Integration

import Adafruit_DHT
import BlynkLib
import time

# Blynk Authentication Token
BLYNK_AUTH = 'Your_Blynk_Auth_Token'

# Initialize Blynk
blynk = BlynkLib.Blynk(BLYNK_AUTH)

# Define DHT sensor type and GPIO pin
DHT_SENSOR = Adafruit_DHT.DHT11
DHT_PIN = 4  # GPIO4 (BCM numbering)

def read_sensor():
    humidity, temperature = Adafruit_DHT.read(DHT_SENSOR, DHT_PIN)
   
    if humidity is not None and temperature is not None:
        print(f"Temp: {temperature:.1f}°C, Humidity: {humidity:.1f}%")
        blynk.virtual_write(0, temperature)  # Send Temperature to Virtual Pin 0
        blynk.virtual_write(1, humidity)  # Send Humidity to Virtual Pin 1
    else:
        print("Failed to read from DHT sensor")

while True:
    read_sensor()
    blynk.run()  # Keep connection with Blynk
    time.sleep(2)  # Read data every 2 seconds

   
5. Run the Code
Save the script as dht11_blynk.py.
Run the script in the terminal:
python3 dht11_blynk.py

Check the output in the terminal and Blynk dashboard.


Observations
The Raspberry Pi successfully reads temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor.
The Serial Terminal prints real-time sensor data.
The Blynk App/Web Dashboard updates values every 2 seconds.
The data is accessible remotely via the Blynk cloud.

Calculations
Convert Temperature (°C to °F):
F=(C×1.8)+32

Humidity range interpretation:
Normal: 30% – 60%
High: >70% (risk of mold)
Low: <30% (causes dryness)
Results
Raspberry Pi successfully reads sensor data.
Sensor data is uploaded to the Blynk cloud.
Blynk displays live temperature and humidity readings.
Remote monitoring is achieved using IoT.

Conclusion
IoT integration is successful with DHT11 and Raspberry Pi.
Data is continuously uploaded to the Blynk cloud for monitoring.
The system can be expanded for weather stations, automation, and smart home applications.
